# Frontend â€” Demo UI

This is a minimal Bootstrap-based UI to demonstrate booking, viewing rooms, and submitting feedback. It expects the backend to be available on the same origin (or adjust `apiBase` in `index.html`).

Open `index.html` directly in a browser for a quick demo, or serve via a static file server.
